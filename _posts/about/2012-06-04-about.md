I'm a web developer living and working in Washington, DC. I'm interested in JavaScript, Node.js, Redis, HTML5, open source and data journalism. I've built a realtime multiplayer game in JavaScript and Node.js using Socket.io, Web Workers and Box2D, explored several PHP MVC frameworks, written a script to [scrape data from a local government site](https://gist.github.com/2569571), crafted a lightweight web app wrapper in Objective-C and dabbled a bit in Ruby on Rails. I'm a conceptual thinker with a broad persepctive, thirst for knowledge, passion for exceptional creative work and an aptitude for rapid prototyping. I prefer working on a Mac and using git for version control. After struggling for years to find a text editor I liked, a coworker introduced me to vim and I fell in love. When I'm not writing code, I enjoy skiing, attempting to surf and playing rugby. You can find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikemorris), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmorri) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpatrickmorris).
